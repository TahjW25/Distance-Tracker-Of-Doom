# Distance-Tracker-Of-Doom
Distance Tracker using Elegoo Uno R3 Microcontroller, HC-SRO4 ultrasonic sensor, and Piezo Buzzer sensor in order to detect how far an
object is from the sensor and outputting a sound using a Piezo Buzzer based on its proximity (â‰¥ 100cm)
Programmed the sound output to be the first 27 notes of the Doom OST, courtesy of the Arduino Pitches
library
Stops when an object exits its field of vision, and resumes from the last note once it re-enters
